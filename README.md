# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone... except with a FAR better mascot. And that's what's <i>really</i> important, isn't it?

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Extra Features

* "Write a New Tweet" button at the top brings down the text area to compose in. Neat eh?
* As you scroll down the page, a button will appear in the bottom right corner that, if clicked on, will gently bring you back up to the text area to compose a new tweet.
* Written with sass-y flair.
